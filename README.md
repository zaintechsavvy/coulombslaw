# Coulombs Law Simulation Lab (Interactive)

This is an interactive web application that allows users to perform calculations related to distances and positions of elements on a grid. It features a modern, responsive design with an interactive SVG canvas for visualization and user-friendly controls.

## Features

*   **Modern, Responsive UI**: The application has been redesigned with a modern aesthetic, using a clean color palette, and a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
*   **Interactive SVG Grid**: A visually appealing SVG grid for visualizing elements.
*   **User-Friendly Controls**: Intuitive controls for manipulating the position of elements, including a "smart spinner" for numeric inputs.
*   **Clear Results Display**: Calculated distances are displayed in a clear and easy-to-read table.
*   **Enhanced User Experience**: Subtle animations, transitions, and a clean typography provide a polished user experience.

## Project Remix & Enhancements

This project is a modernized remix of an older simulation. The original codebase has been significantly updated from its version developed in 2012 to improve its functionality, user experience, and underlying technology. Key enhancements include:

*   **Updated Dependencies**: All external libraries and dependencies have been brought up to their latest stable versions, ensuring better performance and security.
*   **Complete CSS Overhaul**: The application's styling has been completely rewritten to be modern, responsive, and visually appealing. It now uses a clean color palette, improved typography, and a more intuitive layout.
*   **Enhanced Functionality**:
    *   **Persistent K-Value**: The constant 'K' value is now stored, allowing for more consistent and repeatable experiments.
    *   **Manual Data Input**: Users can now manually type in values for fields like separation distance (`r`) and other variables, offering more precise control over the simulation parameters.
*   **Improved User Experience**: The overall user interface has been refined with subtle animations, clearer visual feedback, and a more organized structure.

## How to Use

1.  **Open `index.html` in your web browser (available at https://coulombslaw.vercel.app/).**
2.  **Manipulate the controls** to change the position of the elements on the SVG grid.
3.  The **"Results"** section will update automatically to show the calculated distances.
4.  The **SVG canvas** will visually represent the changes you make.

## Lab Purpose: Investigating Forces

Below is a generalized guide for using this simulation in a lab setting to investigate the relationship between force, distance, and other properties.

**Purpose:** To determine the relationship between a quantitative property of two objects (e.g., electric charge) and the force exerted between them. Additionally, to determine the relationship between the separation distance of the objects and the force between them. Finally, to combine these two relationships into a single comprehensive equation.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5**
*   **CSS3**
*   **JavaScript**
*   **jQuery**
*   **SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)**
*   **Vercel (Hosting)**
